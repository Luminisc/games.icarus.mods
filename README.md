# Icarus Cheaty scripts
Mod with bunch of scripts to make game easier (something is waaaaaay easier).
Scripts can be compiled into `.pak` through `IcarusModBuilder`.

### Changes
- Smelt ore x10 faster, use only 1 ore per craft, and get x10 more ingots
- Pickaxes mine x10 wider, efficient (x10 more ores and stones), and damage
- Ore deposits mining is faster x10
- Mission rewards x10 bigger
- Small wooden crate now have 100 slots

### "Installation"
Use `IcarusModBuilder` to build scripts. You can just throw `BetterMods` folder into IMB `Mods` folder, and build it from application.

##### MRNSTR
Scripts started with `MRNSTR` are reproduction of most changes done in [Icarus Morningstar Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/icarus/mods/45)  
They are here for two reasons:
- Reproduce to understand where items/features are exists in game
- Get rid of original mod, because it was not updated for some time and breaks some of new features and items.

##### OneHitCollection
Same reasons, should be same as [OneHitCollection](https://www.nexusmods.com/icarus/mods/36)
